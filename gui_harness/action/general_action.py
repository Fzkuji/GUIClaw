"""
gui_harness.action.general_action — general-purpose action executed by the agent.

Unlike GUI actions (click, type, etc.) which are specific operations,
general_action gives the agent a sub-task description and lets it use
any available tools to complete it: shell commands, file I/O, keyboard
shortcuts, web browsing, etc.

The agent runs in interactive mode with full tool access (Bash, Read,
Write, etc.) and reports the result when done.
